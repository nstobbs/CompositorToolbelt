# nukePythonScripts
Here are my python scripts I've made for making my life easier in nuke. Feel free to use them if you wish, or not. Don't really care.

Currently the fuctions in this repro is:

Convert Tracker to Transform.

This functions will create a match-move transform node from a tracker node and will set up motion blur.
This function can be accessed with the 'shift + t' hotkey or throught the custom tools menu.

Roto Blur.

This will just create a roto and blur nodes together, with my default setting.
Can be accessed with the 'o' hotkey or with custom tool menu.
